### Introduction
Woofers is a website for a fictional dog rescue created for my end of Bootcamp personal Project.<br>
As I've had many rescue dogs over the years dog rescues are close to my heart.

### Planning
Website brief was generated by ChatGPT using the following query <br>
"Generate a website brief for a dog rescue website, include objectives, taget audience, key features and sample User Stories"

### Website Brief
#### Introduction:
We are seeking to create a website for our dog rescue organization aimed at facilitating the adoption process, raising awareness about responsible pet ownership, and providing resources for dog lovers.
The website will serve as a platform to showcase our available dogs, share success stories, educate visitors about various dog breeds, and encourage donations and volunteer participation.

#### Objectives:
Facilitate the adoption process by showcasing available dogs (front and centre!) and providing adoption guidelines.
Educate visitors about responsible pet ownership, including the importance of spaying/neutering, vaccinations, and training.
Raise awareness about the different dog breeds and their unique characteristics.
Encourage donations and volunteer participation to support our rescue efforts.

#### Target Audience:
- Dog owners struggling to keep or look after their dog
- Potential adopters interested in giving a loving home to rescue dogs.
- Dog lovers looking to learn more about different breeds and responsible pet ownership.
