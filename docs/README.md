### Introduction
Woofers is a website for a fictional dog rescue created for my end of Bootcamp personal Project.<br>
As I've had many rescue dogs over the years dog rescues are close to my heart.

### Planning
Website brief was generated by ChatGPT using the following query <br>
"Generate a website brief for a dog rescue website, include objectives, taget audience, key features and sample User Stories"

### Website Brief

We are seeking to create a website for our dog rescue organization aimed at facilitating the adoption process, raising awareness about responsible pet ownership, and providing resources for dog lovers.
The website will serve as a platform to showcase our available dogs, share success stories, educate visitors about various dog breeds, and encourage donations and volunteer participation.

#### Objectives:
Facilitate the adoption process by showcasing available dogs (front and centre!) and providing adoption guidelines.
Educate visitors about responsible pet ownership, including the importance of spaying/neutering, vaccinations, and training.
Raise awareness about the different dog breeds and their unique characteristics.
Encourage donations and volunteer participation to support our rescue efforts.

#### Target Audience:

Iphone XR, tested on  Apple Safari, Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.
Unfortuneately i have no acccess to Android devices, but third parties have viewed the site on Android Devices.

[Am I Responsive Light mode](images/readme/am-i-responsive-light-mode.png)
[Am I Responsive Dark mode](images/readme/am-i-responsive-dark-mode.png)
[Am I Responsive Dark mode again](images/readme/am-i-responsive-dark-mode-2.png)

#### WAVE Accessibility Tool

#### WCAG Accessibility Tool

[Light Mode Results](images/readme/wcag-light.png)

I'm not sure why the WCAG checker gives such poor results in the dark screen mode when the contrast is clearly very high.

My accessibility tester, (Daniel, my son who is registered blind), found the dark mode to be far easier to read than the light mode.

#### W3 HTML checker
Due to Django tags in HTML W3 Checker was unable to be used as it generated too many errors and stopped.
Instead I used HTML5 validator plugin for Dev Environment and corrected manually as advised.
#### W3 CSS Validator
Picked up on the use of variables "var(--current-div-gradient)" as background-color.

### Bugs

#### Fixed Bugs
- Too many typos, misconceptions and plain wrong ideas to mention.
- Dropdown Menu refused to move to right side, due to missing navbar class.
- On Edit functions, completion message fired twice. Used chat GPT suggestion "Override get_success_message method" 

#### Unfixed Bugs

On Dog Profile edit page, date selection widgets won't display while the DateField will accept a null value.
